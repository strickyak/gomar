# gomar

## Emulator for CoCo &amp; Motorola 6809, specializing in system programming and NitrOS-9 OS.

Work in progress.  See HINT at end of gomar.go.

Portions of https://github.com/strickyak/frobio
are designed to take advantage of this emulator.

But I really need to clean up some more, before documenting and advertizing.

Previously this code was in https://github.com/strickyak/doing_os9 .
